Mini project on ebanking using  selenium hybrid framework
Site used:http://demo.guru99.com/v4/index.php
I have used hybrid model of selenium testing:
PageObjectModel:
Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance. In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file.
Page Factory:
Page Factory is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns. In Page Factory, testers use @FindBy annotation. The initElements method is used to initialize web elements. @FindBy: An annotation used in Page Factory to locate and declare web elements using different locators.
Extent report:
Extent Report is an open-source reporting library used to create visually attractive reports for Selenium tests using JUnit and TestNG. Extent reports produce HTML-based documents that offer several advantages like pie charts, graphs, screenshots addition, and test summary.
Apache POI:
Apache POI is the most commonly used API for Selenium data driven tests. POI is a set of library files that gives an API to manipulate Microsoft documents like . xls and . xlsx. It lets you create, modify, read and write data into Excel.
